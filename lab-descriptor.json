  "introduction": "The Power System Laboratory is designed to provide practical exposure to the fundamental concepts and analytical techniques used in the planning, operation, control, and stability assessment of modern electrical power systems. Through a series of simulation-based experiments, students learn to model power system networks, perform power flow and stability analyses, evaluate system security under contingencies, and understand economic and operational aspects such as load–frequency control and economic dispatch. This laboratory bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world power system applications, enabling learners to analyze complex power networks and develop skills essential for power system engineering practice.",
